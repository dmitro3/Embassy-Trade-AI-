## EMBAI Tokenomics

The $EMBAI token has been designed with a fair and sustainable distribution model that prioritizes community rewards and long-term growth.

### Token Allocation

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Distribution Timeline |
|------------|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Community Rewards | 40% | 4M $EMBAI | Ongoing staking & airdrops |
| $EMB Migration Pool | 20% | 2M $EMBAI | 90-day migration post-Raydium |
| Development | 20% | 2M $EMBAI | 6-month lock, then 12-month vesting |
| Liquidity Pool | 10% | 1M $EMBAI | Token Generation Event (TGE) |
| Reserve Fund | 10% | 1M $EMBAI | DAO-controlled, unlocked as needed |

### Total Supply
- **Initial Supply**: 10M $EMBAI (capped)
- **Emissions**: Potential future emissions via staking rewards, controlled by DAO governance

### Burn Mechanism
$EMB tokens burned during migration reduce the circulating supply, boosting $EMBAI scarcity and value for holders.

### Investor Appeal
60% of the token supply (Community + Migration) directly benefits holders, with a lean development allocation signaling long-term commitment to the project.

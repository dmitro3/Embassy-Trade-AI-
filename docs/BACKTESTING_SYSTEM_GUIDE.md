## Getting Started

### Accessing the Backtesting Dashboard

1. Navigate to the TradeForce AI platform
2. Click on the "Backtesting" link in the navigation menu
3. The backtesting dashboard will load with default settings

### Configuring a Backtest

#### Basic Configuration

1. **Add Trading Symbols**: Enter the symbols you want to backtest (e.g., BTC/USD or Solana token addresses)
2. **Set Date Range**: Choose the time period for your backtest
3. **Select Timeframe**: Choose from options ranging from 15 minutes to 1 day
4. **Set Initial Capital**: Enter your starting capital amount
5. **Select Strategy**: Choose from available trading strategies (AI Consensus, SMA Crossover, RSI)

#### Advanced Settings

1. **Trade Size**: Set the percentage of your portfolio to allocate per trade
2. **Stop Loss**: Configure stop loss percentages to limit potential losses
3. **Take Profit**: Set take profit targets for automatically closing profitable positions
4. **Max Open Trades**: Limit the number of concurrent positions
5. **Trading Fee**: Set the fee percentage for accurate cost simulation
6. **Allow Shorts**: Enable or disable short selling

### Running a Backtest

1. Configure your backtest settings as described above
2. Click the "Run Backtest" button
3. Wait for the backtest to complete (processing time depends on date range and complexity)
4. The system will automatically display the results when finished

### Parameter Optimization

1. Enable the "Parameter Optimization" toggle in the advanced settings
2. The system will test various combinations of:
   - Trade Size percentages
   - Stop Loss percentages
   - Take Profit percentages
3. Click "Run Parameter Optimization" to start the process
4. Review the results ranked by performance
5. Click "Apply Best Parameters" to automatically update your configuration with the optimal settings

## Understanding Backtest Results

### Performance Metrics

- **Return**: The total percentage return of the strategy
- **Win Rate**: The percentage of profitable trades
- **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline during the backtest period
- **Profit Factor**: The ratio of gross profits to gross losses
- **Total Trades**: The number of trades executed during the backtest
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric (higher is better)

### Charts and Visualizations

- **Equity Curve**: Shows the growth of your portfolio value over time
- **Trade Analysis**: Visualizes profit/loss distribution by symbol
- **Trade History Table**: Provides detailed information about each trade

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Simple Tests**: Begin with short timeframes and a single symbol to ensure everything works correctly
2. **Compare Strategies**: Test multiple strategies with the same parameters to compare performance
3. **Avoid Overfitting**: Be cautious about optimizing too many parameters, as this can lead to strategies that work well in backtests but fail in live trading
4. **Consider Market Conditions**: A strategy that performs well in a bull market might fail in a bear market
5. **Account for Slippage**: Enable realistic slippage settings for more accurate results
6. **Validate with Out-of-Sample Testing**: After optimizing, test your strategy on a different time period to validate its robustness

## Integrating with Live Trading

After identifying a successful strategy through backtesting:

1. Navigate to the TradeForce AI settings
2. Update your trading parameters to match the optimized backtest settings
3. Consider starting with smaller trade sizes to validate the strategy in live conditions
4. Monitor performance and compare with backtest results

## Troubleshooting

- **No Data Available**: Ensure you've selected symbols with sufficient historical data for the selected time period
- **Slow Processing**: Reduce the date range or number of symbols for faster results
- **Inconsistent Results**: Make sure you're using consistent parameters when comparing strategies
- **Error Messages**: Check the error details and ensure API keys are properly configured if using private data sources

## Advanced Features

### Custom Strategies

Advanced users can extend the backtesting system by implementing custom strategies:

1. Create a new strategy implementation in the `lib/backtestingSystem.js` file
2. Add your strategy to the strategy selection dropdown
3. Implement your custom logic in the `_applyStrategy` method

### Performance Export

For deeper analysis in external tools:

1. Run your backtest
2. Click the "Export CSV" button on the results page
3. Import the CSV into your preferred analysis software (Excel, Python, R, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning model integration for adaptive strategy optimization
- More sophisticated risk management options
- Multi-asset portfolio backtesting
- Monte Carlo simulation for risk analysis
- Integration with external data sources for sentiment analysis

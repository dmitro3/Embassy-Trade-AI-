# Kraken API Connection Fix for TradeForce AI

This document outlines the changes made to fix the Kraken connection error in the TradeForce AI application.

## Overview of Changes

1. Added proper Kraken API key support in multiple files:
   - Updated `apiKeys.js` to support Kraken API keys
   - Modified `ExchangeConnector.js` to handle Kraken authentication properly
   - Updated `.env.local` to include Kraken API key fields

2. Created utility scripts:
   - `configure-kraken-api.bat` - A tool to set up your Kraken API keys
   - `test-kraken-connection.bat` - A diagnostic tool to verify the connection

3. Added proper error handling and retry logic for Kraken connections

## How to Configure Kraken API Keys

1. Create API keys on Kraken:
   - Go to your Kraken account at https://www.kraken.com/u/security/api
   - Create a new API key with the following permissions:
     - Query Funds
     - Query Open Orders & Trades
     - Query Closed Orders & Trades
     - Create & Modify Orders
   
2. Set up the API keys:
   - Run `configure-kraken-api.bat` in the root directory
   - Enter your API key and secret when prompted

3. Test the connection:
   - Run `test-kraken-connection.bat` to verify that the connection works

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Verify that your API keys are correctly entered
2. Check that your internet connection allows access to api.kraken.com
3. Ensure that the API key has the correct permissions
4. Review the logs in `logs/server.log` for specific error messages

## Technical Details

The connection error was fixed by:

1. Properly handling API key retrieval from both MongoDB and environment variables
2. Adding retry logic with exponential backoff for transient connection issues
3. Implementing proper error handling for both public and authenticated endpoints
4. Adding browser-compatible crypto support for client-side token signing

These changes ensure that the Kraken API connection is robust and can handle various error conditions gracefully.

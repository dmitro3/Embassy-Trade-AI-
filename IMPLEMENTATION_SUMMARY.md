# Implementation Summary: Historical Performance Analysis and MCP Integration

## Overview

This implementation adds two major components to the TradeForce AI Trading System:

1. **Historical Performance Analysis**: A comprehensive dashboard component that tracks and visualizes trading strategy performance over time, including metrics like win rate, drawdown, risk-adjusted returns, and profit/loss trends.

2. **Pump.fun MCP Server**: A new MCP server that monitors Pump.fun token launches, analyzes token risks, and identifies sniping opportunities on Solana.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Historical Performance Analysis

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `components/HistoricalPerformanceAnalysis.js`: Main component for displaying historical performance metrics and visualizations
- `app/api/performance/history/route.js`: API endpoint for retrieving historical performance data
- `components/UnifiedDashboard.js`: Updated to integrate the Historical Performance Analysis component

#### Features:
- **Performance Metrics**: Win rate, drawdown, risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino ratios), profit/loss trends
- **Interactive Charts**: Cumulative P&L, win rate trends, daily P&L, drawdown visualization
- **Time Range Selection**: Filter data by different time periods (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, All)
- **Risk Analysis**: Detailed risk-adjusted return metrics with visual indicators

### 2. Pump.fun MCP Server

#### Files Created:
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/index.js`: Main server file
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/logger.js`: Logging utility
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/services/risk-assessment.js`: Token risk assessment service
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/config/api-keys.js`: API key management
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/README.md`: Documentation
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/package.json`: Dependencies and scripts
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/.env`: Environment variables
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/start-server.bat`: Server startup script
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/test-server.js`: Server testing script
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/test-server.bat`: Test execution script
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/integration-example.js`: Integration example
- `mcp/pumpfun-mcp/test-integration.bat`: Integration test script

#### MCP Tools:
- `get_new_launches`: Retrieves recent token launches with filtering options
- `analyze_token`: Performs detailed risk and opportunity analysis on specific tokens
- `get_sniping_opportunities`: Identifies current sniping opportunities based on configurable criteria
- `monitor_token`: Adds tokens to a monitoring list with price change alerts

#### MCP Resources:
- `monitored_tokens`: List of tokens currently being monitored
- `launch_statistics`: Statistics about recent token launches

#### Features:
- **Real-time Token Launch Monitoring**: Monitors Pump.fun for new token launches
- **Risk Assessment**: Analyzes tokens for various risk factors (liquidity, holder concentration, contract risk, market volatility)
- **Sniping Opportunities**: Identifies potential sniping opportunities based on risk assessment
- **Token Monitoring**: Monitors tokens for price changes and alerts
- **API Integration**: Integrates with SHYFT and Birdeye APIs for token data

## Integration Points

### Historical Performance Analysis Integration
- Integrated into the Portfolio tab of the UnifiedDashboard component
- Connects to the `/api/performance/history` endpoint for data
- Uses the tradeExecutionService to retrieve trade history

### Pump.fun MCP Server Integration
- Designed to be registered with the TradeForce AI MCP client
- Provides tools and resources for token discovery and sniping
- Can be accessed via the MCP client using the server name "pumpfun-mcp"

## Technical Details

### Historical Performance Analysis
- Built with React and Material-UI for the frontend
- Uses Recharts for data visualization
- Implements responsive design for different screen sizes
- Calculates advanced financial metrics like Sharpe and Sortino ratios

### Pump.fun MCP Server
- Built with Node.js and Express
- Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification
- Uses Winston for logging
- Includes comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Simulates WebSocket connection to Pump.fun for token launch monitoring

## Testing

### Historical Performance Analysis
- The component can be tested by navigating to the Portfolio tab in the UnifiedDashboard
- The API endpoint can be tested by making a GET request to `/api/performance/history`

### Pump.fun MCP Server
- Server can be started using `start-server.bat`
- Tests can be run using `test-server.bat`
- Integration can be tested using `test-integration.bat`

## Future Enhancements

### Historical Performance Analysis
- Add more advanced metrics like maximum consecutive wins/losses
- Implement strategy comparison features
- Add export functionality for reports
- Integrate with backtesting system

### Pump.fun MCP Server
- Add real WebSocket connection to Pump.fun when API becomes available
- Enhance risk assessment with machine learning models
- Implement automatic trade execution for high-confidence opportunities
- Add more detailed token analytics and pattern recognition

## Conclusion

The implemented components significantly enhance the TradeForce AI Trading System by adding comprehensive performance analysis capabilities and expanding the MCP integration to leverage the Solana ecosystem. The Historical Performance Analysis component provides traders with valuable insights into their strategy performance, while the Pump.fun MCP Server enables automated monitoring and analysis of new token launches for sniping opportunities.
